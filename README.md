## TodoIIII

This is an add on to [todoIII](https://github.com/jia-hern/todoIII)

In this project we want to add authentication <br>
So a new user can register and login<br>
To do so, we need to include a new user model, a register and a login route<br>
authentication will then be implemented in the frontend with jsonwebtoken<br>
each user should just have accesss to his own todos<br>
